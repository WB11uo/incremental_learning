# incremental_learning
Initial Code for the ICLR 2018 submittion "incremental learning through deep adaptation".
Note that this is a very initial commit. It cannot work straight out of the box due to absolute paths, etc.
The main interesting function here is "makeItControlled" in the .ipynb file which adds controller modules to a new model to re-use modules of an old model.
Everything else is boilerplate,training,testing,experiments.
Please report any issues/comments/suggestions as you may have them.
